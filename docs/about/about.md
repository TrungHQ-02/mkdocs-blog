# About Me

Hi, I’m **Hoàng Quốc Trung** — a DevOps & Platform Engineer passionate about building scalable, secure, and developer-friendly platforms.

## What I Do

I design, build, and operate **cloud-native platforms** that empower engineering teams and streamline operations.  
My core expertise includes:

- **Kubernetes orchestration** – EKS, self-hosted clusters, hybrid environments  
- **AWS infrastructure** – Landing Zones, EC2, VPC, RDS, S3, Serverless, cost optimization  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Terraform, AWS CDK, CloudFormation, Helm  
- **CI/CD automation** – GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins  
- **Observability solutions** – Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, New Relic, OpenTelemetry  
- **Platform engineering** – Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs), self-service provisioning portals, workflow automation  

I’ve worked on **enterprise-scale initiatives**, delivering: - Self-service infrastructure provisioning for developers
- IaC governance frameworks and reusable Terraform modules
- Observability systems for hybrid Kubernetes clusters
- Platform migrations impacting thousands of repositories

## Achievements

- 🏆 **Best Rookie of the Year 2024** — one of only three recognized at FPT Software Hanoi for exceptional impact in the first year  
- 🎯 **Top 1 in Certification Race** — earned multiple cloud & DevOps certifications, including CKA, AWS SAA, Terraform Associate  
- 🎓 **Academic Excellence** — Graduated with a **CPA of 3.91/4.0**, ranked **second** in Computer Science major at Hanoi University of Science and Technology  

## Personal Projects

- **Isolation Node Controller** — Kubernetes controller providing tenant-isolated node pools, integrated with Karpenter for autoscaling  
- **Project Template Generator** — Rapidly bootstraps projects with built-in RBAC, authentication, pre-commit hooks, and lint rules  
- **Blog Engine in Sync with Notion** — Automated pipeline syncing Notion writings to an MkDocs site, deployed via GitHub Actions  

## Why This Blog Exists

This is my space to share:

- Engineering deep dives and platform architecture insights
- Practical DevOps tips and automation patterns
- Learnings from experiments and personal projects
- Or just, some of my thoughts :D

I believe in **building from first principles**, **sharing knowledge**, and **continuously improving** — both the platforms I work on and myself as an engineer.
